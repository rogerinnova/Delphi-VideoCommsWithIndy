# Introduction

I have been working on a video capture and communications project for some time. This project includes video capture and presentation, client communications and server relay. Each applications may be required to run on Android, Linux and/or Windows platforms. The fact that much of the code base is able to be shared across all platforms is an endorsement for Delphi (with a bit of help from Lazarus)

My intention is to share the library aspects of this code at ADUG Melbourne.

This requires some demonstration projects and perhaps more importantly documentation.

# Status

Still early days some library files added and a first cut of the display demos.
